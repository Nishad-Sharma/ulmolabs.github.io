                        <p>Underwater communication is a challenging task due to the unique properties of the underwater
                            environment. The propagation of sound in water is affected by various factors. Ulmo Labs has a proposal
                            that aims to provide UVs with higher quality underwater communication.
                        </p>

                        <p>We are developing a real-time engine that combines an acoustic propagation model, network
                            simulator
                            and updatable digital twin of the undersea environment. The simulator will run on UVs in real-
                            time(milliseconds) to enable the selection of optimal network and signal transmission/processing
                            strategies. The simulator uses hardware accelerated raytracing capability of modern GPUs to
                            achieve a significant speed-up compared to current GPU accelerated models. The performance
                            increases allow the modelling of diffraction, specular reflection and diffuse scattering. The
                            integrated network simulation will evaluate underwater or surface systems as communications
                            relays to extend range and form robust communication networks and strategies.
                        </p>
                        

                        <p>A real-time underwater acoustic simulator provides several operational benefits to underwater
                            communication between UVs, c2 and seabed systems.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>

                        Optimising range and bandwidth:

                        Acoustic propagation modelling can provide modems with information that allows them to select
                        carrier frequencies that maximise bandwidth to a target. Knowledge of when and where a UV is
                        likely to experience communication interruptions due to shadowing or congestion is critical in
                        mission planning. Transmission loss estimation enables mission power budget planning.

                        Mitigating multipath effects:

                        By simulating how sound interacts with the sea floor and surface, a
                        simulator can help select modulation, coding schemes and equalisation strategies

                        Network Formation:

                        Models can predict connectivity between nodes and their feasibility as communication
                        relays.

                        Responding to environmental changes:

                        Real-time simulators ingest environmental data and the locations to provide more accurate
                        simulations.

                        Transmit/receive vector selection:

                        By simulating the propagation of thousands of wave fronts, optimal transmit/receive vectors can
                        be
                        determined. Directional transducers orientated through a mechanical or a phased array system
                        can utilise this knowledge to improve signal quality. Alternatively, the UV could be rotated
                        using
                        control surfaces if a dedicated directional system is not present
